Mode — The most frequently occurring value in the dataset. It is helpful for identifying common patterns.
Range — The difference between the highest and lowest values. It shows data spread.
Variance & Standard Deviation — Measure the amount of variation or spread in the dataset. A high value indicates more variability.
